**Background:**

A python script runs and scraps data from IMDB site for listed genres for top-50 movies.
The data is downloaded in:
> csv files
> html files
Once, we have the data the next steps is to setup a html page for each genre of movie and depict it.
The template.html is used as base template for designing each genre html page.
The beautifulSoup library is used to read data from template and add individual genre contents to a table in this generic template and then at last save these files as html.
